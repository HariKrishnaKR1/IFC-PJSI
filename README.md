## Indicator Frameworks for Sustainability | Localising and Adapting SDG frameworks Using National Public Datasets | Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions


India has many different states, some bigger and more diverse than some countries. But due to this diversity, we also often see conflict due to various diverse backgrounds. This country is also the largest in terms of population as of 2024, and along with it comes the hard task of administering and managuing such a huge diverse population. Thus it is important to not only gain detailed information but also information which is detailed in nature, which raises the need of a localised framework for measuring and collecting data. Also with countries around the world obligated to create sustainable development reports, and also gain information which can help towards equitable and sustainable development, there also raises a need for a framework which can accommodate such diversity and detail.

### Purpose
The framework proposed thus aims to address all the needs above. It uses national public datasets such as the National Crime Records Bureau and the National Judicial Data Grid to create a localised framework. It can be further expanded to accommodate districts and even smaller units to understand the peopleâ€™s needs and develop targeted initiatives for problems to be solved. While Implementation is only till state level but can be done till the district level if needed for a more detailed view with the current data sources itself, even if not recommended. The framework considers that higher the value lower the score is for most of the indicators except for a few.

### Methodology
The data was also weighted and processed to create index scores similar of the SDG scores and compiled accordingly. All targets, while being easily achievable if one is ambitious enough, were weighed relative to the top five performers instead of the most optimal score as a state needs to reach the level of the top five performers on the path of achieving the most optimal score and is also a more realistic and practical scoring method and target in a shorter time duration, similar to how the SDGs have targets to be done within 2030. 

The indicators were then grouped and classified under relevant targets and later presented in a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate dashboard along with an interactive dashboard, which shows the score per indicator visualised on the Indian political map along with the relevant tables and bar graphs. Each indicator is measured on a scale of 0-100, with 100 being the best possible score, and the overall index score is colour-coded as green (goal/target achieved/ on the route of success), yellow (some challenges remaining), orange (significant challenges remaining), or red (major challenges remaining). Below is a brief exploration of the targets and relevant indicators.
